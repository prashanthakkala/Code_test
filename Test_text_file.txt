Certainly! Below is a Python implementation that uses the `ocrmypdf` library to convert a scanned PDF into a searchable and extractable PDF.

### Prerequisites:
1. Install the `ocrmypdf` library:
   ```bash
   pip install ocrmypdf
   ```

2. Ensure you have Tesseract OCR installed on your system. You can download it from [here](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract).

### Python Code:
```python
import ocrmypdf

def convert_to_searchable_pdf(input_pdf_path, output_pdf_path):
    """
    Converts a scanned PDF into a searchable and extractable PDF using OCR.

    :param input_pdf_path: Path to the input scanned PDF file.
    :param output_pdf_path: Path to save the output searchable PDF file.
    """
    try:
        # Run OCRmyPDF to convert the scanned PDF into a searchable PDF
        ocrmypdf.ocr(input_pdf_path, output_pdf_path, deskew=True, optimize=3)
        print(f"Successfully converted {input_pdf_path} to a searchable PDF: {output_pdf_path}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

# Example usage
input_pdf = "scanned_document.pdf"  # Replace with your input PDF file path
output_pdf = "searchable_document.pdf"  # Replace with your desired output PDF file path

convert_to_searchable_pdf(input_pdf, output_pdf)
```

### Explanation:
1. **`ocrmypdf.ocr()`**:
   - This function performs OCR on the input PDF and saves the output as a searchable PDF.
   - The `deskew=True` option automatically corrects skewed pages.
   - The `optimize=3` option optimizes the PDF for smaller file size and better performance.

2. **Input and Output Paths**:
   - Replace `scanned_document.pdf` with the path to your scanned PDF.
   - Replace `searchable_document.pdf` with the desired output file name.

### Example:
If you have a scanned PDF named `scanned.pdf` and want to create a searchable PDF named `searchable.pdf`, run:
```python
convert_to_searchable_pdf("scanned.pdf", "searchable.pdf")
```

This will generate a searchable PDF with embedded text that can be extracted or searched. Let me know if you need further assistance!
